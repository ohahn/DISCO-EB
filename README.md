# DISCO-EB - The DISCO-DJ Einstein-Boltzmann module
Implementation of a differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver for cosmology in JAX -- a module of the DISCO-DJ framework (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology, Done with Jax).

Note that this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

Currently supported features (the list is growing, so check back):

- Autodifferentiable via JAX
- Standard LCDM model with Quintessence DE fluid (w0,wa) and massive neutrinos (one species)
- Thermal history solver based on a simplified Recfast implementation in the module
- Numerous example jupyter notebooks, e.g. for Euclid-like Fisher forecasts
  
New modules/plugins can be easily added (see how to contribute in CONTRIBUTING.md file). We are enthusiastic if extensions/improvements that are of broader interest are re-integrated into the master branch and DISCO-EB grows as a community effort.

Currently work in progress:

- performance improvements

## Installation

### Simple Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ohahn/DISCO-EB.git
```
### For Development

In a fresh virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ohahn/DISCO-EB.git
cd DISCO-EB
pip install -e .
```

#### Running the tests

First install the additional dependencies with the `[dev]` flag:

```bash
cd DISCO-EB
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Then run `pytest` to start the tests. This should be run on GPU platforms.


## Getting started

Start with the sample notebook [nb_minimal_example.ipynb](https://github.com/ohahn/DISCO-EB/blob/master/notebooks/nb_minimal_example.ipynb) in the [notebooks subdirectory](https://github.com/ohahn/DISCO-EB/tree/master/notebooks). It explains how to compute a matter power spectrum and take a derivative w.r.t. a cosmological parameter.

## Benchmarks 

See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for benchmark results on different hardware.

## Contributing and Licensing
