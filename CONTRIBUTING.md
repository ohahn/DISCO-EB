# Contributing

We would love to have your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Submitting a new feature or plugin
- Proposing new features
- Improving documentation

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository. Codebase contributions should be made in the form of pull requests.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Write bug reports with detail and background
A bug report needs

- A quick summary of what happened vs. what should have happened
- Steps to reproduce, e.g. a minimal example that produces the problem.
- Diagnostic output, i.e. what was produced by the program.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Contributed Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. [If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.] (Unit-testing is currently work in progress!)
3. If you've changed APIs, or added new config file options, update the documentation.
4. [Ensure the test suite passes.] (Unit-testing is currently work in progress!)
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue the pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v3 license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to get in touch if that is a concern.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
